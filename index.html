      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Zachary, but you can call me Zach. My parents would prefer if you didn't, after all, they named me that
        for a reason. I am a simple man: I like cars, planes, and lifting weights.</p>
      <div class="new-line"></div>
      <p>Cars are my first love. I was introduced to horsepower at a very young age. My father taught me how how to work
        on cars, how to do it right, and how to enjoy cars after you successfully complete the first two steps. I come from a 
        Chevrolet family and I was lucky enough to drive a 1990 Corvette to high school.</p>
      <div class="new-line"></div>
      <p>Planes are a recent fascination of mine. My father was a pilot and a certified A&P mechanic before he worked on cars. 
        My first experience with an airplane was my 16th birthday. I was gifted a Discovery flight at the local regional 
        airport (Nut Tree, KVCB), which consisted of an hour and a half of white knuckle horror. Being of the current 
        generation of kids, my most recent flight time can be found in Microsoft Flight Simualtor.</p>
      <div class="new-line"></div>
      <p>I also enjoy lifting weights. I was the smallest and skinniest kid growing up, and I eventually had enough. In the
        middle of 2020, I began teaching myself the discipline of working out 6 days a week consistently, progressing over time,
        and stepping outside my comfort zone by pushing the limits. These skills have translated to real-life applications and have
        helped me fortify a strong mind to accompany my strong body.</p>
